**Website Elements Object Detection**
**Overview**
This project focuses on detecting and localizing elements on webpages using object detection techniques. Leveraging the COCO dataset for image data, we employ CNN models and Python libraries like OpenCV, Mediapipe, Keras, PyTorch, and CUDA for effective sensor fusion.

**Setup**
Clone the repository.
Set up your environment with necessary dependencies.
Access the COCO dataset for image data.
Follow the instructions in the provided notebooks/scripts for website elements object detection.

**Usage**
Configure environment and dataset paths.
Execute provided notebooks/scripts for training, validation, and prediction tasks.
Review results and fine-tune parameters as required.

**Folder Structure**
/datasets: Scripts and data related to the COCO dataset and object detection.
/models: Trained CNN models for website elements object detection.
/notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and experimentation.
/scripts: Python scripts for various tasks related to object detection.
